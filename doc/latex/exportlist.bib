   abstract = {Bending of lithospheric plates at subduction zones is thought to be an important source of dissipation for convection in the Earth's mantle. However, the influence of bending on plate motion is uncertain. Here we use a variational description of mantle convection to show that bending strongly affects the direction of plate motion. Subduction of slabs and subsidence of oceanic lithosphere with age provide the primary driving forces. Dissipation is partitioned between plate bending and various sources of friction at plate boundaries and in the interior of the mantle due to viscous flow. We determine the poles of rotation for the Pacific and Nazca plates by requiring the net work to be stationary with respect to small changes in the direction of motion. The best fit to the observed rotation poles is obtained with an effective lithospheric viscosity of 6 x 10(22) Pa s. Bending of the Pacific plate dissipates roughly 40% of the energy released by subduction through the upper mantle. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Oceanic lithosphere thickens and strengthens as it grows older. Worldwide databases reveal that the age of the slab to a certain extent controls the subduction style. Old and thick (and consequently strong) slabs show a trench "advance," while younger, thin (weak) slabs are migrating in retreating style (trench "rollback"). We performed numerical models to show that this configuration could be the result of the dynamic equilibrium between gravity and resisting forces. In particular we show that energy dissipation caused by bending and unbending of the slab, although less important than other resisting forces, could be a primary control on trench migration. Our results fit well with global compilations of kinematic data from modern subduction zones in two reference frames with different amounts of net rotations. Based on the age at which the transition from retreating to advancing style occurs, we propose an effective lithosphere/mantle viscosity of similar to 200 during bending of the lithosphere into the subduction zone.},

   abstract = {Maximum earthquake magnitude and the rate of seismic activity apparently differ among subduction zones. This variation is attributed to factors such as subduction zone temperature and stress, and the type of material being subducted(1-5). The relative velocity between the downgoing and overriding plates controls their tectonic deformation. It is also thought to correlate with seismicity(1,2,6-8). Here I use the epidemic type aftershock sequence model(9,10) to calculate the background seismicity rate-the frequency of seismic events above magnitude 4.5-for 117 sections of subduction zones worldwide, during the past century. I demonstrate a proportionality relationship whereby relative plate velocity correlates positively with seismicity rate. This relationship is prominent in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. However, although seismically active, this region has not experienced a magnitude 9 earthquake since 1900. In contrast, the Cascadia, Nankai, southern Chilean and Alaskan subduction zones exhibit low background seismicity rates, yet have experienced magnitude 9 earthquakes in the past century. Slow slip occurs in many of these regions, implying that slow deformation may aid nucleation of very large earthquakes. The proportionality relationship could be used to assess the seismic risk between two endmembers: active subduction zones that generate moderate earthquakes and quiet subduction zones that generate extremely large earthquakes.},

   abstract = {Our understanding of the dynamics of plate motions is based almost entirely upon modeling of present-day plate motions. A fuller understanding, however, can be derived from consideration of the history of plate motions. Here we investigate the kinematics of the last 120 Myr of plate motions and the dynamics of Cenozoic motions, paying special attention to changes in the character of plate motions and plate-driving forces. We analyze the partitioning of the observed surface velocity field into toroidal (transform/spin) and poloidal (spreading/subduction) motions. The present-day field is not equipartitioned in poloidal and toroidal components; toroidal motions account for only one third of the total. The toroidal/poloidal ratio has changed substantially in the last 120 Myr with poloidal motion decreasing significantly after 43 Ma while toroidal motion remains essentially constant; this result is not explained by changes in plate geometry alone. We develop a self-consistent model of plate motions by (1) constructing a straightforward model of mantle density heterogeneity based largely upon subduction history and then (2) calculating the induced plate motions for each stage of the Cenozoic. The "slab" heterogeneity model compares rather well with seismic heterogeneity models, especially away from the thermochemical boundary layers near the surface and core-mantle boundary. The slab model predicts the observed geoid extremely well, although comparison between predicted and observed dynamic topography is ambiguous. The midmantle heterogeneities that explain much of the observed seismic heterogeneity and geoid are derived largely from late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic subduction, when subduction rates were much higher than they are at present. The plate motion model itself successfully predicts Cenozoic plate motions (global correlations of 0.7-0.9) for mantle viscosity structures that are consistent with a variety of geophysical studies.|We conclude that the main plate-driving forces come from subducted slabs (>90%), with forces due to lithospheric effects (e.g., oceanic plate thickening) providing a very minor component (<10%). For whole mantle convection, most of the slab buoyancy forces are derived from lower mantle slabs. Unfortunately, we cannot reproduce the toroidal/poloidal partitioning ratios observed for the Cenozoic, nor do our models explain apparently sudden plate motion changes that define stage boundaries. The most conspicuous failure is our inability to reproduce the westward jerk of the Pacific plate at 43 Ma implied by the great bend in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain. Our model permits an interesting test of the hypothesis that the collision of India with Asia may have caused the Hawaiian-Emperor bend. However, we find that this collision has no effect on the motion of the Pacific plate, implying that important plate boundary effects are missing in our models. Future progress in understanding global plate motions requires (1) more complete plate reconstruction information, including, especially, uncertainty estimates for past plate boundaries, (2) better treatment of plate boundary fault mechanics in plate motion models, (3) application of numerical convection models, constrained by global plate motion histories, to replace ad hoc mantle heterogeneity models, (4) better calibration of these heterogeneity models with seismic heterogeneity constraints, and (5) more comprehensive comparison of global plate/mantle dynamics models with geologic data, especially indicators of intraplate stress and strain, and constraints on dynamic topography derived from the stratigraphic record of sea level change.},

   abstract = {The maximum earthquake magnitude recorded for subduction zone plate boundaries varies considerably on Earth, with some subduction zone segments producing giant subduction zone thrust earthquakes (e.g. Chile, Alaska, Sumatra-Andaman, Japan) and others producing relatively small earthquakes (e.g. Mariana, Scotia). Here we show how such variability might depend on various subduction zone parameters. We present 24 physical parameters that characterize these subduction zones in terms of their geometry, kinematics, geology and dynamics. We have investigated correlations between these parameters and the maximum recorded moment magnitude (M-W) for subduction zone segments in the period 1900-June 2012. The investigations were done for one dataset using a geological subduction zone segmentation (44 segments) and for two datasets (rupture zone dataset and epicenter dataset) using a 200 km segmentation (241 segments). All linear correlations for the rupture zone dataset and the epicenter dataset (vertical bar R vertical bar = 0.00-0.30) and for the geological dataset ((vertical bar R vertical bar = 0.02-0.51) are negligible-low, indicating that even for the highest correlation the best-fit regression line can only explain 26% of the variance. A comparative investigation of the observed ranges of the physical parameters for subduction segments with M-W > 8.5 and the observed ranges for all subduction segments gives more useful insight into the spatial distribution of giant subduction thrust earthquakes. For segments with M-W > 8.5 distinct (narrow) ranges are observed for several parameters, most notably the trench-normal overriding plate deformation rate (nu(OPD perpendicular to), i.e. the relative velocity between forearc and stable far-field backarc), trench-normal absolute trench rollback velocity (nu(T perpendicular to)), subduction partitioning ratio (nu(SP perpendicular to)/nu(S perpendicular to), the fraction of the subduction velocity that is accommodated by subducting plate motion), subduction thrust dip angle (delta(ST)), subduction thrust curvature (C-ST), and trench curvature angle (alpha(T)). The results indicate that M-W > 8.5 subduction earthquakes occur for rapidly shortening to slowly extending overriding plates (-3.0 <= nu(OPD perpendicular to) < 2.3 cm/yr), slow trench velocities (-2.9 <= nu(T perpendicular to) 2.8 cm/yr), moderate to high subduction partitioning ratios (vspi/vs,. 0.3-1.4), low subduction thrust dip angles (bsT s 30), low subduction thrust curvature (C-ST <= 2.0 x 10(-13) m(-2)) and low trench curvature angles (-6.3 degrees <= alpha(T) <= 9.8 degrees). Epicenters of giant earthquakes with M-W > 8.5 only occur at trench segments bordering overriding plates that experience shortening or are neutral (nu(POD perpendicular to). < 0), suggesting that such earthquakes initiate at mechanically highly coupled segments of the subduction zone interface that have a relatively high normal stress (deviatoric compression) on the interface (i.e. a normal stress asperity). Notably, for the three largest recorded earthquakes (Chile 1960, Alaska 1964, Sumatra-Andaman 2004) the earthquake rupture propagated from a zone of compressive deviatoric normal stress on the subduction zone interface to a region of lower normal stress (neutral or deviatoric tension). Stress asperities should be seen separately from frictional asperities that result from a variation in friction coefficient along the subduction zone interface.|We have developed a global map in which individual subduction zone segments have been ranked in terms of their predicted capability of generating a giant subduction zone earthquake (M-W > 8.5) using the six most indicative subduction zone parameters (nu(OPD perpendicular to), nu(T perpendicular to), nu(SP perpendicular to)/nu(S perpendicular to), delta(ST), C-ST and alpha(T)). We identify a number of subduction zones and segments that rank highly, which implies a capability to generate M-W > 8.5 earthquakes. These include Sunda, North Sulawesi, Hikurangi, Nankai-northern Ryukyu, Kamchatka-Kuril-Japan, Aleutians-Alaska, Cascadia, Mexico-Central America, South America, Lesser Antilles, western Hellenic and Makran. Several subduction segments have a low score, most notably Scotia, New Hebrides and Mariana. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {[1] Plate coupling between oceanic and continental plates in convergent margins of Andean type is analyzed from the continuum mechanics approach. We postulate a simple mechanism that accounts for the compressive regime in Andean-type environments. In this mechanism, deformation in the continental lithosphere is split into two distinctive domains: The forearc domain and the arc-foreland domain. The forearc deformation is controlled by the balance between buoyancy forces associated with the trench and continental slope relief and the stress transferred from the convergence velocity through the age- and velocity-dependent slip zone. The arc-foreland deformation is controlled by the absolute plate velocity of the continental plate and the resistance at the slip zone. Strength of the coupling zone is determined by analyzing the dynamic trench topography along the active margin of South America between 0 and 55 degreesS. Using this approach, we found strength values in the range of 20 - 95 MPa, in strong direct correlation with the age of the subducting plate. The slip layer strength observation has been successfully tested against a thermal- and strain rate-dependent rheological model. From this theoretical result we define an empirical relationship between strength of the slip zone and the age and convergence velocity. Applying this plate coupling model, we reproduce shortening rates in the order of 1 - 10 km/Myr, in agreement with those reported for the late Tertiary evolution of the Andes. Model results reproduce some first-order features of the geological evolution of the margin, such as the shape of the trench, the overall Andes relief, the Altiplano buildup, and block rotation patterns. In addition, the model provides a mechanism to explain the evolution of the Central Depression, the inversion of Tertiary basins under slow convergence rates during the Miocene, and the segmentation of the margins tectonic erosion.},

   abstract = {How cratons-extremely stable continental areas of the Earth's crust-formed and remained largely unchanged for more than 2,500 million years is much debated. Recent studies of seismic-wave receiver function data have detected a structural boundary under continental cratons at depths too shallow to be consistent with the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, as inferred from seismic tomography and other geophysical studies. Here we show that changes in the direction of azimuthal anisotropy with depth reveal the presence of two distinct lithospheric layers throughout the stable part of the North American continent. The top layer is thick (similar to 150 km) under the Archaean core and tapers out on the surrounding Palaeozoic borders. Its thickness variations follow those of a highly depleted layer inferred from thermo-barometric analysis of xenoliths. The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary is relatively flat (ranging from 180 to 240 km in depth), in agreement with the presence of a thermal conductive root that subsequently formed around the depleted chemical layer. Our findings tie together seismological, geochemical and geodynamical studies of the cratonic lithosphere in North America. They also suggest that the horizon detected in receiver function studies probably corresponds to the sharp mid-lithospheric boundary rather than to the more gradual lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary.},
